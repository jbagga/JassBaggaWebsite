            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            <p> My name is Jass. I just finished my Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics at Simon Fraser University, in British Columbia, Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the summer of 2013, I have worked as a Software Engineering intern at Microsoft. I will soon be working full time as an engineer. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Until then I am teaching myself more about Operating Systems and creating my website from scratch.
